                    <h3>Body</h3>
                    <p>The body is the largest part of the guitar and plays a significant role in producing sound. Acoustic guitars
                        have a hollow body with a soundhole, while electric guitars have a solid body that relies on pickups and
                        amplifiers for sound.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="neck">
                    <h3>Neck</h3>
                    <p>The neck is the long, narrow part of the guitar that connects the body to the headstock. It houses the
                        fretboard, frets, and truss rod for adjustments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="fretboard">
                    <h3>Fretboard</h3>
                    <p>The fretboard, or fingerboard, is the flat surface on the neck where you press the strings to change pitch.
                        It contains frets, which divide notes into semitones.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="headstock">
                    <h3>Headstock</h3>
                    <p>The headstock is located at the end of the neck and contains the tuning pegs for adjusting string tension and
                        tuning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="strings">
                    <h3>Strings</h3>
                    <p>Guitars typically have six strings, tuned from lowest to highest as E, A, D, G, B, and e. They are made from
                        materials like nylon or steel.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="bridge">
                    <h3>Bridge</h3>
                    <p>The bridge anchors the strings to the body. On acoustic guitars, it transfers string vibration to the
                        soundboard. Electric guitars use the bridge to stabilize string tension, sometimes incorporating a tremolo
                        system.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="pickups">
                    <h3>Pickups (Electric Guitars Only)</h3>
                    <p>Pickups are magnetic components that convert string vibrations into electrical signals for amplification.
                        Single-coil pickups offer a bright sound, while humbuckers provide a warmer, fuller tone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-part" id="controls">
                    <h3>Controls (Electric Guitars Only)</h3>
                    <p>Electric guitars often have controls for volume, tone, and pickup selection.</p>

                    <h3>Acoustic Guitars</h3>
                    <p>Acoustic guitars are designed to amplify sound naturally without electronics. They feature a hollow body with
                        a soundhole that resonates vibrations. Commonly used in genres like folk and classical, acoustic guitars are
                        ideal for unplugged performances and do not require additional equipment like amplifiers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-type" id="electric">
                    <h3>Electric Guitars</h3>
                    <p>Electric guitars rely on pickups and amplifiers to produce sound. Their solid body minimizes natural
                        resonance, making them ideal for genres like rock, blues, and metal. They are highly versatile with
                        adjustable tones through pickups and effects.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guitar-type" id="differences">

                    <h3>Scales</h3>
                    <p>Scales are patterns of notes that form the basis of music:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major Scale:</strong> A foundational scale with a happy sound (e.g., C Major: C, D, E, F, G, A,
                            B).</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor Scale:</strong> A scale with a sadder tone (e.g., A Minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="theory-topic" id="chords">
                    <h3>Chords</h3>
